## How the Internet Works
### Basic Principles
- **Data Transmission:** The Internet transmits data using a protocol called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).
- **Servers and Clients:** Websites are hosted on servers, which send data to client devices (like your computer) upon request.

### Connecting to the Internet
- **ISP:** Internet Service Providers (ISPs) offer access to the Internet through various technologies like DSL, cable, fiber optics, or satellite.
- **Routers and Modems:** Devices that connect your home network to your ISP, allowing multiple devices to access the Internet.
